Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) 
:- 

I will create a Student schema in MongoDB like this:

Student {
  id: unique identifier (For unique indentificcation of each student)
  username: unique anonymous username (e.g. Student1234) (For making each student distinguish by the name)
  startLocation: { lat, lng } (It is the starting location from where the student start to walk from home to school or college)
  destinationLocation: { lat, lng } (It is the destination from where the student reach from start to end )
  routeWaypoints: list of points along the route (lat/lng) ( It will various list of endpoints or ways by which you can reach the destination in faster and efficient way)
  createdAt: timestamp
}

To ensure usernames are unique and anonymous, I will:
function generateUniqueUsername():
  do:
    username = "Student" + random 4-digit number (I will generate random 4 digit number by Math.random for generating random number and enclose it to Math.floor for making it to an suitable numbers only )
  while username exists in DB (checking whether student exits in db or not)
  return username

When a student sends their route, I will:
 1. I will frst generate the unique username
 2. Calculate route waypoints using Google Maps Directions API
 3. Save this route and user info to the Database that is mongodb 

 I want to find routes that are close to each other or that cross or share some parts:
 I will compare the new route waypoints with those already in the mongodb. 
 If any points are within 0.5 km radius and total overlap crosses a threshold value,
 then I will consider them matched.

API endpoint to add student route:
POST /api/routes
  Receive startLocation, destinationLocation
  Generate unique username
  Calculate route waypoints
  Store new student record
  Loop over existing students in DB:
    if routes overlap, add to matchedStudents list
  Return { username, matchedStudents }

For chatting, I will use WebSocket (Socket.IO):
On client connect:
  Authenticate username
On "send_message":
  Save message to DB
  Emit to recipient
On "get_messages":
  Retrieve chat history between two usernames
  Send to client

Frontend (React + Google Maps + Socket.IO client)
On the frontend, I will do the following:

1. Create inputs for start and destination addresses
2. Use Google Maps feature that is Geocoder to convert addresses to lat/lng
3. Send start and destination coords to backend API Routes

On receiving response:
  Save assigned anonymous username
  Display the route on the map using DirectionsRenderer
  Display markers for matched students (anonymous usernames at their start locations)

When user clicks on a matched student's marker:
  Open a chat window
  Connect to WebSocket and fetch chat messages
  Allow real-time sending and receiving of messages anonymously

I will manage state for:
- User's start and destination inputs
- User's anonymous username
- Matched students list
- Chat window open state and messages

The map will show:
- User's route
- Markers for matched students

Route Matching Logic (Backend)
function routesOverlap(route1, route2):
  overlapCount = 0
  for point in route1:
    if any point in route2 is within 0.5 km:
      overlapCount++
  if overlapCount > threshold:
    return True
  else:
    return False

Full User Flow
User opens the app
User enters home and destination addresses
By using Google maps I geocode those addresses to lat/lng on frontend
I send this data to my backend APIS
Backend generates an anonymous username and calculates the full route waypoints
Backend saves the student's route info and compares with existing students
Backend returns matched students (anonymous usernames + locations)
Frontend shows the user's route and matched students on the map
User clicks a matched student's icon to open chat window
Users chat anonymously in real-time via WebSocket
